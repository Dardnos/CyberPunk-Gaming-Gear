# Design Guidelines

## This document

This document is meant to be a reference and an agreement between the different users when it comes to designing,
coding and releasing pages of the website.
It consists of the following:

- Theme
- Color scheme
- Hierarchy and layout
- Images
- Icons
- Typography
- Border rounding
- Shadows

## Theme

Our theme for the website is futuristic/cyberpunk style.
It has a high contrast in colors within our selected color scheme.

## Color

The colors used on the website will consist of:

Main colors

- Black #000000
- Yellow #FCEE09

Accent colors:

- Cyan #36EBf2
- Red #FF003C

## Hierarchy and layout

Our website is primate based around gaming and gaming equipment.
This will be apparent immediately on entering the page.
The products that will be displayed first are the items of high value, such as pre-built PCs and gaming consoles.
Further down the page, there will be controllers, keyboards,
headsets and other accessories that compliment the main products.
The bottom of the page will display items of low value, such as batteries, keycaps and smaller accessories.
The section difference is based on what subpage you are visiting,
but the recurring similarities will be a mixture of header text and normal text,
sprinkled with fitting images organized in a way that is not cluttered, but pleasant and clear to look at.
FOr the layout in our product section,
we want the customers to see the image first, then the text and lastly the rating.
As for the about us page, where items are not in focus, the user sees the text first, followed by our logo.


## Images

Images that will be used should be royalty-free and clear.
Captions will be used on products to allow for names and description of their content.

## Icons

Icons will be used in places where they would add clarity or illustrate a function/section within the website.

The icons will be colored in our color scheme or white to make it stand out from the background and other elements.

## Typography

The font is preferably thin with sharp edges.

## Border rounding

No border rounding will be used because that would not work with the "cyberpunk" style that we are going for.

## Shadows

We opted to not use shadowing because we feel it would not compliment the background colors well.
